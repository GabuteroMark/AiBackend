Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. This process is essential for life on Earth because it provides oxygen and food for other living organisms. The process takes place mainly in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, which powers the chemical reactions of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light- independent reactions (Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed to produce energy-rich molecules such as ATP and NADPH. Water molecules are also split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is used along with ATP and NADPH to synthesize glucose. The glucose produced can be used immediately for energy or stored as starch for later use. Factors affecting photosynthesis include light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, temperature, and the availability of water and nutrients. Optimal conditions are necessary for plants to perform photosynthesis efficiently.
